My first python-cum-SQL based GUI project where we can store and retrieve our passswords whenever necessary.
MyPasswordManager, A Project mainly coded in Python with a graphical user interface using the inbuilt python library tkinter which uses the SQL database to store and retrieve the information for which the user has requested for in the executebale file. 
You must have an SQL database in you PC to run this code. 
Updates will be frequently committed to refine the usability of this project.
The Code has Class 3 Security as of now and the security patch will be updated as possible.
